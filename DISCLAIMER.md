* Source HTML dependency: This extension relies on HTML generated by Polarion for a LiveDoc.
* Standards compliance adjustments: Polarion’s HTML output is not always compliant with W3C specifications. To ensure usable documents, we normalize and repair the HTML before rendering. These modifications range from cosmetic fixes to structural changes when necessary.
* DOCX rendering engine: DOCX generation is performed by Pandoc. Its behavior is outside our control.
* Testing and compatibility: Our HTML transformations are covered by automated tests and are validated against new releases of both this extension and Polarion. However, we cannot anticipate every document variant or future change in Polarion’s HTML.
* No guarantee of fidelity: We cannot guarantee that every conversion will be perfectly accurate. Please review each generated document to verify that its structure and content are preserved as expected.
* User responsibility and feedback: You are responsible for validating the output for your use case. If you encounter issues, please report them with sample input and environment details (Polarion version, extension version, Pandoc version).
